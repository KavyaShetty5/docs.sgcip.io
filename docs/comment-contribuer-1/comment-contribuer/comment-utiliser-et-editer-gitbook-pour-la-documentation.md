{% endhint %}

### üë§ Step 1: Create an account

Configurez un compte GitBook sur [https://www.gitbook.com/](https://www.gitbook.com). It's best to create your GitBook account using your GitHub account so that changes can be attributed to you [dans les sources](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/docs.sspcloud.fr/tree/master/docs).

### üîìStep 2: Get Access

Pour obtenir l'acc√®s, poster un message sur[ le canal Tchap](https://tchap.gouv.fr/#/room/#SSPCloudXDpAw6v:agent.finances.tchap.gouv.fr) en demandant un acc√®s √† l'√©dition et l'√©criture et suivez le lien qu'il vous sera transmis. Ce lien vous donnera un acc√®s en √©dition aux documents publics SPP Cloud ainsi qu'√† l'espace interne SPP Cloud .

### üë∑ Step 3 : Access the editing interface

[Cliquez sur ce lien](https://app.gitbook.com/@sspcloud/spaces) to access our dashboard. Once on our dashboard, select the SPP Cloud space or create a new space.

You will now have a sidebar with draft options. Click on any page and start typing/editing to start a new draft.

A draft can contain edits on multiple pages. You can also create new pages by hovering over the sidebar :

### üö©Step 4 : Page organization

Concerning the organization of the pages, we built the Gitbook in the following way:

* **Onyxia - Guide** for all the Onyxia platform walkthroughs
* **Tutorials** for various aids, guides and training
* **Demonstrations** to propose pieces of code, exploratory projects, etc.
* **News** to write a blog post or present an event
* **Projets** to present datalab use cases and the services and features used. [Comment pr√©senter un projet ?](broken-reference/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
After making a change or adding a page, consider describing the changes with a short message by clicking "Describe this draft" in the Drafts section of the sidebar and writing a short description :
{% endhint %}

### üîÑ Step 5: Publish content

After writing and saving your draft and giving it a description. There are two possible cases :

1. You've written a fairly long draft, you're not sure the style is entirely consistent with the rest of our material, you've had a problem, or you've just written a quick draft that needs feedback, advice or corrections.
2. You made a minor edit or spent a lot of time creating a neat, cohesive page that you believe is error-free.

If you fall into case 1, or if you don't identify with either case, please send a message in[ le canal Tchap](https://tchap.gouv.fr/#/room/#SSPCloudXDpAw6v:agent.finances.tchap.gouv.fr). In this case, the team will take care of all copy editing, formatting, etc. remaining and publish your draft. You have finished!

If you fall into case 2, you can simply publish your draft by clicking the blue "Merge" button in the sidebar. If you are unsure whether the draft is error-free, please use the default case 1; the more eyes watching the work, the better.
