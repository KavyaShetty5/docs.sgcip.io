## Onyxia Scale'Up meetings

Beyond the technical resources made available to everyone via the SSP Cloud instance, the Onyxia project represents a real opportunity for public statisticians to **discover and adopt new ways of working**. The Onyxia Scale'Up meetings are an opportunity to share projects carried out using Onyxia between users. The objective is to illustrate how the platform can allow you to gain freedom and of **simplify your deployments**.

The chosen format is resolutely turned towards the  **user feedback**. Centered around a given subject, each meeting will be introduced by a member of the Onyxia project, who will present the possibilities offered by the platform. Then there will be several users, who will try to transmit their experience in a complete but accessible way in order to make it usable by as many people as possible.
